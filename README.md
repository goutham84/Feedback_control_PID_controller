# Advanced Temperature Regulation of CSTR

This project implements temperature control of a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) using both PID and Fuzzy Logic controllers in MATLAB Simulink. The project explores auto-tuning for PID and the design of fuzzy logic membership functions to enhance process control. Various adaptive control strategies like Relative Least Squares (RLS) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) were evaluated, outperforming traditional PID in robustness and dynamic performance.

## Key Features:
- MATLAB Simulink models for PID and Fuzzy Logic control of CSTR.
- Auto-tuned PID with improved settling time and reduced overshoot.
- Adaptive control strategies comparison for enhanced process robustness.
